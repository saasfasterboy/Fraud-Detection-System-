Fraud Detection System
Description
This project involves creating a classification model to detect fraudulent transactions. By identifying and preventing fraudulent activities, businesses can save significant financial losses and protect customer trust.

Why
Early detection of fraud is crucial for minimizing financial losses and maintaining customer confidence in financial systems and services.

Tasks
Gather Transaction Data: Collect datasets that contain transaction records for analysis. Example datasets can be found here (insert a link to your datasets).

Preprocess Data:

Feature Engineering: Create new features that can help improve model accuracy.
Handling Imbalanced Data: Use techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation (e.g., SMOTE) to address imbalances in the dataset.
Train Classification Models:

Implement various classification algorithms, such as:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Gradient Boosting
Evaluate Model Performance:

Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to assess model performance.
Conduct cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
Implement in a Real-Time System:

Integrate the trained model into a real-time fraud detection system.
Develop a mechanism to monitor transactions and flag potential fraud in real-time.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (or any other libraries you choose to use)
